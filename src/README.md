* Enter your name before clicking your seat.
* To free your seat, select it a second time, and make sure it is green.  
* Once it is green again, feel free to reselect your new seat.
* When printing the boarding pass, make sure that you are on the correct flight 
where you reserved your seat.  You can only print your pass immediately after you
have selected your seat, otherwise you must exit the program and rerun it.  During the rerun 
though, when printing the pass, you will print out all the passengers on that current flight.
